AI Customer Support – Starter Package
Welcome 👋

You’re about to deploy your first real AI customer support system — not a demo, not a toy.

This Starter package lets you:

Automatically answer repetitive customer emails

Save 10–15 hours per week

Test AI support in production with almost zero cost

🚀 What This Package Is

This is a production-ready AI email support workflow built with:

n8n → workflow automation

OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) → AI brain

Knowledge Base (Qdrant-ready) → accurate answers

Email (IMAP/SMTP) → works with Gmail, Outlook, etc.

⚠️ Important
This is NOT:

A chatbot demo

A SaaS subscription

A hosted service

👉 You own everything and run it yourself.
